# Sonore Music Streaming App - Hero Section Update

## Overview
This update enhances the main content area of the music streaming app with a new interactive hero section featuring a hover-activated card carousel.

## New Features

### Hero Section
- **Brown/Orange Gradient Background**: Uses `linear-gradient(to right, #4B2E1A, #8B5A2B)` for an attractive visual appeal
- **Hover-Activated Content**: The hero section reveals interactive content when hovered

- **Card Carousel**: Horizontal scrollable row of music cards (150x150px) that appears on hover

### Interactive Cards

- **Click Handlers**: Each card is clickable with customizable actions

### Responsive Design

- **Flexible Layout**: Uses Flexbox for proper content alignment
- **Adaptive Sidebar**: Sidebar collapses appropriately on smaller screens

### Generic Component Architecture
- **MusicCard Component**: Reusable card component with props for dynamic data
- **Customizable Props**: Title, subtitle, image, size, click handlers
- **Size Variants**: Small, medium, and large card sizes
