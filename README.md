## Project overview

Sonore is intended to be a full-stack music streaming platform where users can:
- Browse and search music (tracks, albums, artists)
- Stream tracks with minimal buffering
- Create and share playlists
- Like or favorite tracks for quick access
- Manage a profile and view listening history

This repository contains the source code and configuration to run Sonore locally and deploy it to production.

## Key features

- Fast, resilient audio streaming
- Modern responsive UI (desktop & mobile)
- Search and discovery (by track, artist, album, genre)
- Playlist management
  - Create playlists: build and save custom playlists from any tracks in the catalog.
  - Blend playlists: merge or "blend" multiple playlists into a single listening session (mix tracks from several playlists while preserving order/weights).
- Video lookup for songs: checkout videos of a song — the backend can generate a best-effort YouTube search query (and return a video id) so clients can show the official music video, lyric video, or official audio when available.
- Link songs: attach external links or related-track references to songs (for example, link to remixes, alternate versions, or artist pages).
- Focus queue feature: create a temporary, focused playback queue — build sessions by duration, by genre/language filters, or by blended playlists to reduce distractions and keep listening tightly curated.
- User authentication and profiles
- Basic analytics (listening counts, favorites)
- Extensible architecture for integrations (third-party catalogs, ads, social)

## Tech stack

- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node.js + Express 
- Database: MongoDB
- Media storage / streaming: Cloudinary
- Authentication: JWT and Oauth2
- Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier

Adjust this section to reflect the actual technologies used in this repository.

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for running database / services)

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Riya922003/Sonore-Music-Streaming-.git
   cd Sonore-Music-Streaming-

2. Install dependencies
   - If the project is monorepo with folders like `client/` and `server/`, run installation in each folder:
     cd client && npm install
     cd ../server && npm install
   - Otherwise from repo root:
     npm install

3. Setup environment variables
   - Copy the example env file and edit:
     cp .env.example .env
   - Populate required values (see "Environment variables" below).

4. Run services (local dev)
   - Start backend:
     cd server
     npm run dev
   - Start frontend:
     cd client
     npm run dev
   Or, use the root dev command if provided:
     npm run dev

5. Open the app
   - Front-end typically runs at http://localhost:3000
   - API typically runs at http://localhost:4000 (adjust if different)

## Production / build

Build the application for production:

- Front-end:
  cd client
  npm run build
  npm run start (or serve static assets)

- Back-end:
  cd server
  npm run build
  npm run start

Or use Docker for a containerized build:

- Build images:
  docker-compose build

- Start services:
  docker-compose up -d

Refer to docker-compose.yml (if present) for details.

## Environment variables

The application requires a set of environment variables to run. Example variables (adjust to your implementation):

- SERVER_PORT=4000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/sonore
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3|local
- S3_BUCKET=name-of-bucket
- S3_REGION=region
- S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
- S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
- NODE_ENV=development|production

Place sensitive values in `.env` and never commit them. Use .env.example to show names and expected format.

## File structure (suggested)

If your repo follows a common structure, it may look like:

- client/ — Front-end app (React/Next/Vue)
- server/ — API and streaming server
- packages/ — Shared packages (optional)
- scripts/ — Utility scripts and deployment helpers
- docker-compose.yml
- .env.example
- README.md

Update this section to match the actual structure of this repository.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
3. Implement changes and add tests where applicable
4. Run linting and tests
5. Open a pull request describing the changes

Please follow the existing code style and add tests for new functionality. If you intend to make a large change, open an issue first to discuss the design.

## Tests

Run tests with:
- For server:
  cd server
  npm test
- For client:
  cd client
  npm test

Use `npm run test:watch` for interactive development if supported.

## Deployment

Common deployment approaches:
- Deploy front-end static build to Vercel, Netlify, or S3 + CloudFront
- Deploy back-end to Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS / EKS, or a VPS
- Use managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL) and object storage (S3/GCS) for media

If this repo includes CI/CD configs (GitHub Actions, etc.), review `.github/workflows` for the deployment pipeline.

## Roadmap

Planned improvements:
- Offline playback & caching
- Collaborative playlists
- Recommendations & personalized radio
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- Monetization features (subscriptions, ads)

Additional planned / upcoming features:
- Blend playlists (improved controls and weighting for mixed playlists)
- Focus queue enhancements (duration-based queue generation, smarter sampling)
- Link songs / related content (deeper linking for remixes, videos, and artist pages)
- AI Music Insights (coming soon): an AI-powered dashboard that will analyze tracks and listening patterns to provide insights such as mood, key, tempo, segment highlights, recommended playlists, and personalized analytics for creators and listeners.

Open issues and feature requests are tracked in GitHub Issues. Please add ideas or request features there.
