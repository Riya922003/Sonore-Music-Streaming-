## Project overview

Sonore is intended to be a full-stack music streaming platform where users can:
- Browse and search music (tracks, albums, artists)
- Stream tracks with minimal buffering
- Create and share playlists
- Like or favorite tracks for quick access
- Manage a profile and view listening history

This repository contains the source code and configuration to run Sonore locally and deploy it to production.

## Key features

- Fast, resilient audio streaming
- Modern responsive UI (desktop & mobile)
- Search and discovery (by track, artist, album, genre)
- Playlist management
  - Create playlists: build and save custom playlists from any tracks in the catalog.
  - Blend playlists: merge or "blend" multiple playlists into a single listening session (mix tracks from several playlists while preserving order/weights).
- Video lookup for songs: checkout videos of a song — the backend can generate a best-effort YouTube search query (and return a video id) so clients can show the official music video, lyric video, or official audio when available.
- Link songs: attach external links or related-track references to songs (for example, link to remixes, alternate versions, or artist pages).
- Focus queue feature: create a temporary, focused playback queue — build sessions by duration, by genre/language filters, or by blended playlists to reduce distractions and keep listening tightly curated.
- User authentication and profiles
- Basic analytics (listening counts, favorites)
- Extensible architecture for integrations (third-party catalogs, ads, social)

## Tech stack

- Front-end: React
- Back-end: Node.js + Express 
- Database: MongoDB
- Media storage / streaming: Cloudinary
- Authentication: JWT and Oauth2
- Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier

## Quick start (development)

Prerequisites
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
  
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/Riya922003/Sonore-Music-Streaming-.git
   cd Sonore-Music-Streaming-

2. Install dependencies
   - If the project is monorepo with folders like `client/` and `server/`, run installation in each folder:
     cd frontend && npm install
     cd backend && npm install
   - Otherwise from repo root:
     npm install
     
4. Run services (local dev)
   - Start backend:
     cd backend
     node server.js
   - Start frontend:
     cd frontend
     npm run dev
   Or, use the root dev command if provided:
     npm run dev

5. Open the app
   - Front-end typically runs at http://localhost:3000
   - API typically runs at http://localhost:4000 (adjust if different)

## Production / build

Build the application for production:

- Front-end:
  cd client
  npm run build
  npm run start (or serve static assets)

- Back-end:
  cd server
  npm run build
  npm run start

## Environment variables

The application requires a set of environment variables to run. Example variables (adjust to your implementation):

- SERVER_PORT=4000
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/sonore
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3|local
- S3_BUCKET=name-of-bucket
- S3_REGION=region
- S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
- S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx
- NODE_ENV=development|production

Place sensitive values in `.env` and never commit them. Use .env.example to show names and expected format.

## Contributing
